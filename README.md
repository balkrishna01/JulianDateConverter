# Julian Day Calculator
This Python script calculates the Julian day of a given date. The Julian day represents the day of the year, ranging from 1 to 366, where January 1st is day 1 and December 31st is day 366 in a leap year.

## How It Works
1. Function Definition: The script defines a function get_julian_day(date) that takes a datetime object and returns the Julian day as a string.

2. User Input: The script prompts the user to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If the user does not provide a date, the script uses the current date.

3. Date Parsing: If a date is provided, the script tries to parse it. If the format is incorrect, an error message is displayed, and the script exits.

4. Julian Day Calculation: The Julian day for the provided or current date is computed and displayed.

## Usage
1. Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment.

2. Input Date: Enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD when prompted. Press Enter to use today's date.

3. View Result: The script will print the Julian day corresponding to the entered or current date.

### Example
````bash
$ python julian_day_calculator.py
````
Enter a date (YYYY-MM-DD) or press Enter to use today's date: 2024-08-30
The Julian day for the date 2024-08-30 is: 243
### Error Handling
- If an invalid date format is entered, the script will notify you and exit with an error code.
